            <h1>Waxing Treatments Available</h1>
            <p>Waxing is a form of semi-permanent hair removal which removes the hair from the root. New hair will not grow back in the
            previously waxed area for four to six weeks, although some people will start to see regrowth in only a week due to some
            of their hair being on a different growth cycle. Almost any area of the body can be waxed, including eyebrows, face,
            pubic area (called bikini waxing), legs, arms, back, abdomen, and feet. There are many types of waxing suitable for
            removing unwanted hair.</p>
